Tokens that have been created as outlined in `Create tokens <create-tokens.html>`_, can be claimed.

A claim is the first step to obtaining a balance on the token in question. Once made, it shows up under *My previous claims* in red and the option to *Submit Proof*.

Proving
^^^^^^^

For a claim to be successful, all the proofs specified by the token creator have to be provided and get approved - automatically or by the chosen person, group or sensor. The proof submission site for a claim that uses the *Password* proof and the *ClaimableOnlyNTimes* proof, looks like this for instance.

The *ClaimableOnlyNTimes* proof does not have to be initated manually. It belongs to the category of proofs that automatically give their approval or rejection once a claim is made.

Once all proofs are provided and approved, the claim appears as green and the claimer gets a balance on this token.

Claims under *My previous claims* can be in one of three stages:

- In red and the prompt to *Submit proof*, this is the default after submitting a new claim
- In green, the approved state, which also means that a balance has to be minted to the claimer
- In gray, the rejected state, if one or more of the proofs got manually or automatically rejected
