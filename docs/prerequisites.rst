Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^

FIN4Xplorer consists of two parts:

- Smart contracts that are deployed to the Ethereum network (the Rinkeby test network for now). The entire functionality is in these smart contracts. Everything could also be done by interacting to them via a command line.
- A "frontend" in the form of a *Web DApp* that acts as an user interface for convenient interaction with said smart contracts. Web apps run directly in the browser, both on desktop computers and on smartphones. DApp stands for distributed app and means that it runs on a blockchain. The only, yet significant, difference this makes to a visitor of a Web DApp, is that a bridge to the blockchain is needed. MetaMask acts as such a bridge.

MetaMask
^^^^^^^^

In desktop browsers MetaMask can be installed as extension and for mobile (iOS and Android) they have an early-access App. Links to all installations can be found at http://metamask.io.
