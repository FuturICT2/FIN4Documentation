Application overview

Home
~~~~

*Home* acts as landing page and is the central place of the DApp.

The two main subsites are accessible in the bottom bar: `Tokens`_ and `Claims`_.

Tokens
~~~~~~

Under *Tokens* new tokens can be created as described in `Create tokens <create-tokens.html>`_. On the right side all existing tokens are listed with direct links to claiming them or to view more details about them.

Claims
~~~~~~

The layout of the *Claims* site is analog to the *Tokens* site: submitting new claims can be done on the left side and a list of previous claims is displayed on the right side. If users get to this site via a *Claim*-Link on a token directly, the *Token Type* will be prefilled. More info about the claiming process can be found in `Claim tokens <claim-tokens.html>`_.
