"The basic idea is: anyone can create tokens and anyone can claim these "
"tokens. Once a claim is made, the user has to provide proof that the "
"associated positive action actually happened. Which proof or proofs these"
" are, is decided by the token creator when designing the token. If all "
"proofs on a claim are automatically (e.g. a location to be within a "
"certain circle) or manually (e.g. someone involved in the action is asked"
" to approve a photo) approved, the claimer gets an amount \"minted\" on "
"that token. We say someone \"gets tokens\", which basically means that "
"that persons public address gets an entry in the balance-sheet on the "
"respective token with a positive number."
