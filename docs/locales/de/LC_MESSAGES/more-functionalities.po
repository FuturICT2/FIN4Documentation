#: ../../more-functionalities.rst:98
msgid ""
"Listing is the central place of the TCR, here, the curation of OPATs is "
"happening. After applying a token to the listing that is not already on "
"it, a voting period starts where users can vote for taking it in or not. "
"Only in the reveal period where votes can't be changed anymore it will "
"become public what users voted for, not before. Depending on the quorum "
"parameter as can be seen under `Parameters`_ the majority of votes decide"
" what happens. If a token makes it onto the listing, it can be "
"challenged. This triggers another vote/reveal procedure which results in "
"kicking the token off the listing or keeping it. The proposer or "
"challenger has to put GOV on stake and gets rewarded if the vote turns "
"out in their favor or looses GOV if it does not."

"The other functionality here is to delegate some of your GOV to a user of"
" your choosing and see how much GOV in total was delegated to you, if "
"any. The idea being that an user might trust another user to participate "
"in governance procedures on their behalf because they are for instance "
"more competent in a certain topic. Unlike all other token transfers, this"
" amount can be refunded from the sender."

"Similar to collectively deciding if a token should be on the listing or "
"not, the parameters of the system as a whole can be changed collectively."
" The procedure is similar and involves proposing a new value for a "
"parameter, followed by vote and reveal phase after which the new value is"
" accepted or rejected. The GOV required to put on stake for a proposed "
"reparameterization are much higher then those for proposing a token. The "
"idea being that reparameterizations should happen very rarely and only if"
" a proposer is \"serious\" about it."
